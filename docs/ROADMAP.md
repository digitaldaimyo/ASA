# Roadmap

- Reproduce notebook training runs with larger configs and publish checkpoints.
- Expand probe suite (Paris-margin variants, routing entropy, slot diversity).
- Add dataset adapters for HF datasets (with optional dependencies).
- Improve slotspace refinement fidelity to match notebook interventions.
- Add GPU-specific performance benchmarks and profiling utilities.
