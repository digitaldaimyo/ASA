\section{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item No large-scale benchmarks are reported.
  \item The Paris-margin probe is intentionally simple.
  \item The relationship between \ASA routing and standard transformer attention
  remains to be formally characterized.
  \item Stability and scaling behavior at very long context lengths remain open.
\end{itemize}
