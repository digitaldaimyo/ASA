\section{Conclusion}

Addressed State Attention introduces a persistent routing substrate that
separates control from content in sequence models. Through controlled
interventions, we show that factual recall in \ASA-based models is primarily
mediated by routing dynamics rather than residual representations. \ASA thus
provides both a modeling primitive and a framework for studying how sequence
models store, retrieve, and control information over time.
