\section{Reproducibility}

This release includes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item MIT-licensed source code
  \item CPU-friendly sanity tests and demos
  \item A public pretrained checkpoint
  \item Analysis notebooks documenting routing dynamics
\end{itemize}

The release emphasizes a clear separation between library code, experiments,
and analysis, prioritizing runnable demos and architecture-accurate naming.

\paragraph{Code and checkpoints.} The reference implementation and scripts are
available at \url{https://github.com/digitaldaimyo/ASA}, and the public model
checkpoint is hosted on Hugging Face at
\url{https://huggingface.co/DigitalShogun/ASA-ASM-wikitext103-raw}.
